- [Deep Learning-Based Fault Diagnosis of Photovoltaic Systems: A Comprehensive Review and Enhancement Prospects](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9530686)
Faults can be divided into two types depending on their evolution: significant faults and minor faults. The design of a multi-level diagnosis framework in the deep network model will help achieving the real-time monitoring of significant faults and effectively improve the diagnosis of random faults. In addition, significant faults affect the system performance differently, and small faults are also very likely to cause considerable damage.
**Thus, it is important to develop DL-based algorithms that consider the fusion of faults from different manufacturing environments with different characteristics.**
Moreover, classical DL algorithms are generally utilized to model the dynamic nature of multivariable PV systems in both the offline training and online updating phases using the updated measurements. Instead, using online extensions of DL models for diagnosis in the first place may reduce the training and update time. In addition, complex PV systems often have problems such as uncertainty, multiple fault occurrence, and fault levels changing with time. If only a single FDD technology is used, the accuracy and generalization will be low. Thus, combining multivariate statistical analysis (such as: PCA [15]–​[17], kernel PCA [18]–​[20]), signal processing (such as: Fourier transform, multiscale representation [13], [21], interval-valued data representation [22], [23]), and other tools with DL models could improve the performance of the FDD and more specifically decision-making accuracy. It could also reduce the impact of noise, outliers [24], and uncertainties and estimate the severity of the fault location.

*The accuracy and generalization of non-fusion methods (simple methods) are low, and they exhibit poor robustness. Therefore, it is necessary to combine different variables for analysis.*

*非融合方法（简单方法）的准确率和泛化性低，鲁棒性差，所以有必要组合不同变量进行分析。*

**Photovoltaic (PV) solar energy recorded an exponential growth, in worldwide scale, over the last decade. Inevitably, mature PV markets are becoming highly competitive, boosting the need for research and development (R&D) on efficiency and reliability optimization, maintenance and fault diagnosis of key components, such as the PV modules.**
The power generation of PV plants and the consequent payback time of investments on PV installations, are significantly dependent on the operational lifetime of PV modules and their electrical performance.
Apart from the obvious merit of such long warranty, PV modules technology can become even more attractive for consumers and investors if the energy production cost is further minimized, while at the same time, reliability and durability are kept at top level during operation [11]. 

*After the expansion phase, competition in the photovoltaic market shifts from capacity to optimization of efficiency and reliability, as well as maintenance and fault diagnosis.*

*在扩张阶段之后，光伏市场的竞争不再是产能而是效率和可靠性优化、维护和故障诊断。*
