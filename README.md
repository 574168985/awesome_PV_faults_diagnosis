# awesome_PV_faults_diagnosis
literature review renewal of PV faults diagnosis, including papers, datasets, and codes

# PLAN

To start literature review, we focus on:

- [ ] [Image-based diagnosis for PV cells, modules and plants](#IMAGE-BASED-METHODS)
- [ ] [Fusion-based (images and other signals (electrical, thermal, …)](#FUSION-BASED-METHODS)
- [ ] [Find if there exist public datasets with PV images for diagnosis](#PUBLIC-IMAGE-BASED-DATASET-SUMMARY )

# IMAGE BASED METHODS

What kind of images, how they are collected, processed, which kind of faults (type, severity, …), the application level (cell, module, string, plant), the results (simulation or experimental) accuracy and so on

# FUSION BASED METHODS

What kind of images, how they are collected, processed, how the fusion is done, which kind of faults, the application, the results (simulation or experimental) accuracy and so on

It would be relevant to check if there is any paper review. If not we can be the first to do so.

Additionally, inference models, data-driven algorithms, and learning methods widely used in control and maintenance are considered more specifically applicable to certain conditions, problems, or datasets, lacking universality in the same aspects. However, despite the significant successes reported in most papers, it must be noted that this success is based on tuning specific parameters of particular models while maintaining default parameters of other models. Furthermore, some models proposed based on input data may not be universally applicable.

While deep learning-based photovoltaic potential analysis using 2D aerial images incorporates structural information, it lacks slope and shadow information. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate learning these details from aerial images or combining 2D and 3D data to further improve potential estimation accuracy. In addition to photovoltaic potential analysis, rich 3D models can also drive other research and applications, such as urban noise diffusion modeling, roof insulation assessment, or estimation of building energy demands.]**
